The MicrobiomeStat package is a dedicated R tool for exploring
*longitudinal microbiome data*. It also accommodates multi-omics data
and cross-sectional studies, valuing the collective efforts within the
community. One of its standout features is the ability to generate
comprehensive microbiome analysis reports, spanning dozens of pages,
with just a single click. This tool aims to support researchers through
their extensive biological inquiries over time, with a spirit of
gratitude towards the community’s existing resources and a collaborative
ethos for furthering microbiome research.

## News

🌟 **Also Check Out: `mLLMCelltype`**

We're excited to introduce `mLLMCelltype`, our innovative framework for **single-cell RNA sequencing data annotation**. This iterative multi-LLM consensus framework leverages the collective intelligence of multiple large language models (including GPT-4o/4.1, Claude-3.7/3.5, Gemini-2.0, Grok-3, and others) to significantly improve cell type annotation accuracy while providing transparent uncertainty quantification.

`mLLMCelltype` addresses critical challenges in scRNA-seq analysis through its unique architecture:

- **Multi-LLM Consensus**: Overcomes single-model limitations by harnessing diverse LLMs' collective intelligence
- **Structured Deliberation**: Enables models to share reasoning, evaluate evidence, and refine annotations through collaborative discussion
- **Transparent Uncertainty Metrics**: Provides quantitative measures to identify ambiguous cell populations requiring expert review
- **Hallucination Reduction**: Suppresses inaccurate predictions through cross-model critical evaluation
- **No Reference Dataset Required**: Performs accurate annotation without pre-training or reference data

For researchers working with single-cell data, `mLLMCelltype` offers a powerful new approach to cell type annotation. Learn more about its capabilities and methodology on GitHub: [mLLMCelltype Repository](https://github.com/cafferychen777/mLLMCelltype).

📢 **Update** (January 8th): Enhancement in Color Palette Functionality

We are excited to announce a significant update to our color palette
management in the majority of our functions. Users can now directly use
predefined palette names such as “lancet”, “nejm”, among others, as
values for the `palette` parameter. This update is part of our ongoing
effort to enhance user experience and provide more intuitive and
flexible options for data visualization.

Key highlights of this update: - Integration of the `mStat_get_palette`
function across various functions in our package. - Allows users to
easily specify color palettes by name, such as “lancet”, “nejm”, “npg”,
“aaas”, “jama”, “jco”, and “ucscgb”. - Ensures backward compatibility
and introduces a more user-friendly approach to selecting color schemes
for visualizations. - Aims to enhance the visual appeal and
interpretability of plots and heatmaps generated using our package.

This update is immediately available and we encourage users to explore
these new options in their analyses. For detailed usage, please refer to
the updated function documentation.

📢 **Update** (October 20th): The Shiny interface is now officially
available for use. It is currently configured to handle analysis for
small to medium-sized datasets. The interface can be accessed via [this
link](https://microbiomestat.shinyapps.io/MicrobiomeStat-Shiny/).

In the event of server limitations affecting your analysis, or for those
preferring to work with smaller modules, we recommend using our package
directly. For a more flexible deployment, consider cloning our Shiny
repository from
[here](https://github.com/cafferychen777/MicrobiomeStat-Shiny) and
deploying it on your local server or computer.

We appreciate your understanding and continued engagement.

## Important Note on CRAN Version

The `MicrobiomeStat` package is under continuous development. As a
result, the most recent features have not yet been incorporated into the
version available on the CRAN repository. The current CRAN version
supports only the `linda` and `linda.plot` functions. For users who
require a broader range of functionalities, especially those related to
the analysis of longitudinal data, it is advisable to install the
development version directly from GitHub. This process necessitates the
prior installation of the `devtools` package.

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
```

Once `devtools` is installed, you can install `MicrobiomeStat` from
GitHub using the following command:

``` r
devtools::install_github("cafferychen777/MicrobiomeStat")
```
