The `MicrobiomeStat` package is a state-of-the-art R tool with a **special focus on the analysis of longitudinal microbiome data**. While capable of handling multi-omics data and cross-sectional studies, its **core strength lies in its proficiency in longitudinal analysis**. This makes it an invaluable resource for researchers conducting extensive biological studies over time.

# Citations {#citations}

## General Citation for MicrobiomeStat {#general-citation}

If you are using features beyond the `linda` and `linda.plot` functions, please cite as follows, until a preprint version is published:

```
@Manual{,
  title = {MicrobiomeStat: Comprehensive Statistical and Visualization Methods for Microbiome and Multi-Omics Data},
  author = {Xianyang Zhang and Jun Chen and Caffery(Chen) Yang},
  year = {2023},
  note = {R package version 1.1.1},
  url = {https://www.microbiomestat.wiki},
}
```

## Citation for Specialized `MicrobiomeStat` Functions {#specialized-citation}

If you are using the `linda`, `linda.plot`, `generate_taxa_association_test_long`, `generate_taxa_test_pair`, `generate_taxa_test_single`, or `generate_taxa_trend_test_long` functions, please cite the following paper:

```
@article{zhou2022linda,
  title={LinDA: linear models for differential abundance analysis of microbiome compositional data},
  author={Zhou, Huijuan and He, Kejun and Chen, Jun and Zhang, Xianyang},
  journal={Genome biology},
  volume={23},
  number={1},
  pages={1--23},
  year={2022},
  publisher={BioMed Central}
}
```

We will update the citation guidelines as soon as the preprint is published.

## Important Note on CRAN Version {#cran-version-note}

Due to the **ongoing development cycle**, the **most up-to-date features** of `MicrobiomeStat` have **not yet been uploaded to the CRAN repository**. The current CRAN version **only supports the `linda` and `linda.plot` functions**. If you **require additional functionalities**, particularly for **analyzing longitudinal data**, we recommend **installing the development version from GitHub**. To do this, you'll first need to **install the `devtools` package** if you haven't already:

```R
install.packages("devtools")
```

Once `devtools` is installed, you can install `MicrobiomeStat` from GitHub using the following command:

```R
devtools::install_github("cafferychen777/MicrobiomeStat")
```
