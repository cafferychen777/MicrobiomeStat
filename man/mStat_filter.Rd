\title{Filter a Microbiome Data Matrix by Prevalence and Average Abundance}
\usage{
mStat_filter(x, prev.filter, abund.filter)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A matrix containing taxa (in rows) and sample (in columns) microbial abundance data.}

\item{prev.filter}{Numeric, the minimum prevalence threshold for a taxon to be
retained. Prevalence is calculated as the proportion of samples where the
taxon is present.}

\item{abund.filter}{Numeric, the minimum average abundance threshold for a taxon
to be retained. For data with negative values, set to -Inf to disable abundance filtering.}
}
\value{
A matrix with taxa filtered based on the specified thresholds.
}
\description{
This function filters taxa in a microbiome matrix based on specified
prevalence and average abundance thresholds.
}
\details{
The function first converts the input data into a long format and then groups by taxa.
It computes both the average abundance and prevalence for each taxon. Subsequently, it
filters out taxa that do not meet the provided prevalence and average abundance thresholds.

\examples{

# Example with simulated data
\dontrun{
data_matrix <- matrix(c(0, 3, 4, 0, 2, 7, 8, 9, 10), ncol=3)
colnames(data_matrix) <- c("sample1", "sample2", "sample3")
rownames(data_matrix) <- c("taxa1", "taxa2", "taxa3")

filtered_data_simulated <- mStat_filter(data_matrix, 0.5, 5)
print(filtered_data_simulated)
}

# Example with real dataset: peerj32.obj
\dontrun{
data(peerj32.obj)
data_matrix_real <- peerj32.obj$feature.tab

# Assuming the matrix contains counts with taxa in rows and samples in columns
filtered_data_real <- mStat_filter(data_matrix_real, 0.5, 5)
print(filtered_data_real)
}
