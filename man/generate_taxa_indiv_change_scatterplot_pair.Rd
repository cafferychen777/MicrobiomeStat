\arguments{
\item{data.obj}{A list object in a format specific to MicrobiomeStat, which can include components such as feature.tab (matrix), feature.ann (matrix), meta.dat (data.frame), tree, and feature.agg.list (list). The data.obj can be converted from other formats using several functions from the MicrobiomeStat package, including: 'mStat_convert_DGEList_to_data_obj', 'mStat_convert_DESeqDataSet_to_data_obj', 'mStat_convert_phyloseq_to_data_obj', 'mStat_convert_SummarizedExperiment_to_data_obj', 'mStat_import_qiime2_as_data_obj', 'mStat_import_mothur_as_data_obj', 'mStat_import_dada2_as_data_obj', and 'mStat_import_biom_as_data_obj'. Alternatively, users can construct their own data.obj. Note that not all components of data.obj may be required for all functions in the MicrobiomeStat package.}

\item{subject.var}{A string indicating the variable for subject identifiers.}

\item{time.var}{A string indicating the variable for time points.}

\item{group.var}{Optional string specifying the variable for groups.}

\item{strata.var}{Optional string specifying the variable for strata.}

\item{change.base}{A string indicating the base time point for change computation. This should match one of the time points present in the metadata for the 'time.var' variable.}

\item{feature.change.func}{Specifies the method or function used to compute the change between two time points.
The following options are available:

- "absolute change": Computes the difference between the count values at the two time points (`count_ts` and `count_t0`).

- "log fold change": Computes the log2 fold change between the two time points. For zero counts, imputation is performed using half of the minimum nonzero value for each feature level at the respective time point before taking the logarithm.

- "relative change": Computes the relative change as `(count_ts - count_t0) / (count_ts + count_t0)`. If both time points have a count of 0, the change is defined as 0.

- A custom function: If a user-defined function is provided, it should take two numeric vectors as input corresponding to the counts at the two time points (`count_t0` and `count_ts`) and return a numeric vector of the computed change. This custom function will be applied directly.}

\item{feature.level}{The column name in the feature annotation matrix (feature.ann) of data.obj
to use for summarization and plotting. This can be the taxonomic level like "Phylum", or any other
annotation columns like "Genus" or "OTU_ID". Should be a character vector specifying one or more
column names in feature.ann. Multiple columns can be provided, and data will be plotted separately
for each column. Default is NULL, which defaults to all columns in feature.ann if `features.plot`
is also NULL.}

\item{features.plot}{A character vector specifying which feature IDs (e.g. OTU IDs) to plot.
Default is NULL, in which case features will be selected based on `top.k.plot` and `top.k.func`.}

\item{feature.dat.type}{The type of the feature data, which determines how the data is handled in downstream analyses.
Should be one of:
- "count": Raw count data, will be normalized by the function.
- "proportion": Data that has already been normalized to proportions/percentages.
- "other": Custom abundance data that has unknown scaling. No normalization applied.
The choice affects preprocessing steps as well as plot axis labels.
Default is "count", which assumes raw OTU table input.}

\item{top.k.plot}{Integer specifying number of top k features to plot, when `features.plot` is NULL.
Default is NULL, in which case all features passing filters will be plotted.}

\item{top.k.func}{Function to use for selecting top k features, when `features.plot` is NULL.
Options include inbuilt functions like "mean", "sd", or a custom function. Default is NULL, in which
case features will be selected by abundance.}

\item{prev.filter}{Numeric value specifying the minimum prevalence threshold for filtering
taxa before analysis. Taxa with prevalence below this value will be removed.
Prevalence is calculated as the proportion of samples where the taxon is present.
Default 0 removes no taxa by prevalence filtering.}

\item{abund.filter}{Numeric value specifying the minimum abundance threshold for filtering
taxa before analysis. Taxa with mean abundance below this value will be removed.
Abundance refers to counts or proportions depending on \code{feature.dat.type}.
Default 0 removes no taxa by abundance filtering.}

\item{base.size}{A numeric value specifying the base font size for the plot.}

\item{theme.choice}{Plot theme choice. Can be one of:
  - "prism": ggprism::theme_prism()
  - "classic": theme_classic()
  - "gray": theme_gray()
  - "bw": theme_bw()
Default is "bw".}

\item{custom.theme}{A custom ggplot theme provided as a ggplot2 theme object. This allows users to override the default theme and provide their own theme for plotting. To use a custom theme, first create a theme object with ggplot2::theme(), then pass it to this argument. For example:

```r
my_theme <- ggplot2::theme(
  axis.title = ggplot2::element_text(size=16, color="red"),
  legend.position = "none"
)
```

Then pass `my_theme` to `custom.theme`. Default is NULL, which will use the default theme based on `theme.choice`.}

\item{palette}{A character vector specifying the color palette. Default is NULL.}

\item{pdf}{A logical value indicating whether to save the plot as a PDF. Default is TRUE.}

\item{file.ann}{A string for additional annotation to the file name. Default is NULL.}

\item{pdf.wid}{A numeric value specifying the width of the PDF file. Default is 11.}

\item{pdf.hei}{A numeric value specifying the height of the PDF file. Default is 8.5.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to be passed to the function.}
}
\value{
A list of ggplot objects, one for each taxonomic level.
}
\description{
This function generates scatterplots to visualize the change in taxonomic composition of samples between two time points in a longitudinal study.
It also provides options for grouping and stratifying data, and selecting the top k features based on a user-defined function.
}
\details{
This function generates a scatterplot of the change in taxa abundances between two time points in a longitudinal study.
The scatterplot can be stratified by a group variable and/or other variables.
It also allows for different taxonomic levels to be used and a specific number of features to be included in the plot.
The function also has options to customize the size, theme, and color palette of the plot, and to save the plot as a PDF.
