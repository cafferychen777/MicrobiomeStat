\arguments{
\item{data.obj}{A list object in a format specific to MicrobiomeStat, which can include components such as feature.tab (matrix), feature.ann (matrix), meta.dat (data.frame), tree, and feature.agg.list (list). The data.obj can be converted from other formats using several functions from the MicrobiomeStat package, including: 'mStat_convert_DGEList_to_data_obj', 'mStat_convert_DESeqDataSet_to_data_obj', 'mStat_convert_phyloseq_to_data_obj', 'mStat_convert_SummarizedExperiment_to_data_obj', 'mStat_import_qiime2_as_data_obj', 'mStat_import_mothur_as_data_obj', 'mStat_import_dada2_as_data_obj', and 'mStat_import_biom_as_data_obj'. Alternatively, users can construct their own data.obj. Note that not all components of data.obj may be required for all functions in the MicrobiomeStat package.}

\item{subject.var}{A string indicating the variable for subject identifiers.}

\item{time.var}{A string indicating the variable for time points.}

\item{group.var}{A string indicating the variable for group identifiers. Default is NULL.}

\item{strata.var}{A string indicating the variable for stratum identifiers. Default is NULL.}

\item{feature.level}{The column name in the feature annotation matrix (feature.ann) of data.obj
to use for summarization and plotting. This can be the taxonomic level like "Phylum", or any other
annotation columns like "Genus" or "OTU_ID". Should be a character vector specifying one or more
column names in feature.ann. Multiple columns can be provided, and data will be plotted separately
for each column. Default is NULL, which defaults to all columns in feature.ann if `features.plot`
is also NULL.}

\item{feature.dat.type}{The type of the feature data, which determines how the data is handled in downstream analyses.
Should be one of:
- "count": Raw count data, will be normalized by the function.
- "proportion": Data that has already been normalized to proportions/percentages.
- "other": Custom abundance data that has unknown scaling. No normalization applied.
The choice affects preprocessing steps as well as plot axis labels.
Default is "count", which assumes raw OTU table input.}

\item{feature.number}{A numeric value indicating the number of top abundant features to retain in the plot. Features with average relative abundance ranked below this number will be grouped into 'Other'. Default 20.}

\item{features.plot}{A character vector specifying which feature IDs (e.g. OTU IDs) to plot.
Default is NULL, in which case features will be selected based on `top.k.plot` and `top.k.func`.}

\item{base.size}{A numeric value indicating the base font size for the plot.}

\item{theme.choice}{Plot theme choice. Specifies the visual style of the plot. Can be one of the following pre-defined themes:
  - "prism": Utilizes the ggprism::theme_prism() function from the ggprism package, offering a polished and visually appealing style.
  - "classic": Applies theme_classic() from ggplot2, providing a clean and traditional look with minimal styling.
  - "gray": Uses theme_gray() from ggplot2, which offers a simple and modern look with a light gray background.
  - "bw": Employs theme_bw() from ggplot2, creating a classic black and white plot, ideal for formal publications and situations where color is best minimized.
  - "light": Implements theme_light() from ggplot2, featuring a light theme with subtle grey lines and axes, suitable for a fresh, modern look.
  - "dark": Uses theme_dark() from ggplot2, offering a dark background, ideal for presentations or situations where a high-contrast theme is desired.
  - "minimal": Applies theme_minimal() from ggplot2, providing a minimalist theme with the least amount of background annotations and colors.
  - "void": Employs theme_void() from ggplot2, creating a blank canvas with no axes, gridlines, or background, ideal for custom, creative plots.
Each theme option adjusts various elements like background color, grid lines, and font styles to match the specified aesthetic.
Default is "bw", offering a universally compatible black and white theme suitable for a wide range of applications.}

\item{custom.theme}{A custom ggplot theme provided as a ggplot2 theme object. This allows users to override the default theme and provide their own theme for plotting. Custom themes are useful for creating publication-ready figures with specific formatting requirements.

To use a custom theme, create a theme object with ggplot2::theme(), including any desired customizations. Common customizations for publication-ready figures might include adjusting text size for readability, altering line sizes for clarity, and repositioning or formatting the legend. For example:

```r
my_theme <- ggplot2::theme(
  axis.title = ggplot2::element_text(size=14, face="bold"),        # Bold axis titles with larger font
  axis.text = ggplot2::element_text(size=12),                      # Slightly larger axis text
  legend.position = "top",                                         # Move legend to the top
  legend.background = ggplot2::element_rect(fill="lightgray"),     # Light gray background for legend
  panel.background = ggplot2::element_rect(fill="white", colour="black"), # White panel background with black border
  panel.grid.major = ggplot2::element_line(colour = "grey90"),     # Lighter color for major grid lines
  panel.grid.minor = ggplot2::element_blank(),                     # Remove minor grid lines
  plot.title = ggplot2::element_text(size=16, hjust=0.5)           # Centered plot title with larger font
)
```

Then pass `my_theme` to `custom.theme`. If `custom.theme` is NULL (the default), the theme is determined by `theme.choice`. This flexibility allows for both easy theme selection for general use and detailed customization for specific presentation or publication needs.}

\item{palette}{A character vector specifying the color palette. Default is NULL.}

\item{pdf}{A logical value indicating whether to save the plot as a PDF. Default is TRUE.}

\item{file.ann}{A string for additional annotation to the file name. Default is NULL.}

\item{pdf.wid}{A numeric value specifying the width of the PDF file. Default is 11.}

\item{pdf.hei}{A numeric value specifying the height of the PDF file. Default is 8.5.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to be passed to the function.}
}
\value{
A list of ggplot objects of the taxa barplots.
}
\description{
This function generates pairwise barplots to visualize the taxonomic composition of samples for longitudinal data.
It also provides options for grouping and stratifying data.
}
\details{
This function generates a barplot of taxa proportions for longitudinal data.
The barplot can be stratified by a group variable and/or other variables.
It also allows for different taxonomic levels to be used and a specific number of features to be included in the plot.
The function also has options to customize the size, theme, and color palette of the plot, and to save the plot as a PDF.
