\usage{
generate_taxa_per_time_test_long(
  data.obj,
  subject.var,
  time.var = NULL,
  group.var = NULL,
  adj.vars = NULL,
  feature.level,

}
\arguments{
\item{data.obj}{A MicrobiomeStat data object containing microbiome data and metadata.}

\item{subject.var}{A string specifying the column name in meta.dat that uniquely identifies each subject.}

\item{time.var}{Optional; a string representing the time variable in the meta.dat. If provided, enables longitudinal analysis.}

\item{group.var}{Optional; a string specifying the group variable in meta.dat for between-group comparisons.
Can be either:
\itemize{
  \item Categorical (factor or character): Creates pairwise comparisons between groups
  \item Continuous (numeric or integer): Tests for linear association
}}

\item{adj.vars}{Optional; a vector of strings representing covariates in meta.dat for adjustment in the analysis.}

\item{feature.level}{A string or vector of strings indicating the taxonomic level(s) for analysis (e.g., "Phylum", "Class").}

\item{prev.filter}{Numeric; a minimum prevalence threshold for taxa inclusion in the analysis.}

\item{abund.filter}{Numeric; a minimum abundance threshold for taxa inclusion in the analysis.}

\item{feature.dat.type}{The type of the feature data, which determines how the data is handled.
Should be one of:
\itemize{
  \item "count": Raw count data. This function will first apply TSS (Total Sum Scaling) normalization,
        then LinDA performs zero-handling using half-minimum approach for statistical testing
  \item "proportion": Pre-normalized proportional data. LinDA performs zero-handling using
                      half-minimum approach without additional normalization
}
Default is "count".}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to other methods.}
}
\value{
A nested list structure where:
\itemize{
  \item First level: Named by time points (\code{time.var} levels)
  \item Second level: Named by \code{feature.level} (e.g., "Phylum", "Genus")
  \item Third level: Named by tested comparisons between groups
        (e.g., "Level vs Reference (Reference)" for categorical variables,
        or variable name for continuous variables)
  \item Each final element is a data.frame with the following columns:
        \itemize{
          \item \code{Variable}: Feature/taxon name
          \item \code{Coefficient}: Log2 fold change (categorical) or slope (continuous)
          \item \code{SE}: Standard error of the coefficient
          \item \code{P.Value}: Raw p-value from LinDA's statistical test
          \item \code{Adjusted.P.Value}: FDR-adjusted p-value (Benjamini-Hochberg)
          \item \code{Mean.Abundance}: Mean abundance across all samples at that time point
          \item \code{Prevalence}: Proportion of samples where feature is present (non-zero)
        }
}

Analysis is performed separately for each time point using LinDA mixed-effects models.

\description{
This function performs differential abundance testing across multiple time points in longitudinal microbiome data. It is tailored to analyze how the abundance of microbial taxa varies over time, within different groups or under various conditions.
}
\details{
The function integrates various data manipulations, normalization procedures, and statistical tests to assess the significance of taxa changes over time or between groups. It allows for the adjustment of covariates and handles both count and proportion data types.

The function constructs a mixed-effects model formula based on the provided variables, handling fixed and random effects to account for repeated measures in subjects. It performs filtering based on prevalence and abundance thresholds and applies normalization and aggregation procedures as necessary.

Importantly, the function conducts differential abundance analysis separately for each time point in the longitudinal data. This approach allows for the identification of taxa that show significant changes at specific time points, providing insights into the dynamics of the microbiome over time.
