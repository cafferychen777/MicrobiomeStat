\title{Aggregate Feature Table by Taxonomy Level}
\usage{
mStat_aggregate_by_taxonomy(data.obj, feature.level = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data.obj}{A MicrobiomeStat data object (list) containing at minimum:
\itemize{
  \item \code{feature.tab}: Feature table (matrix) with taxa as rows
  \item \code{feature.ann}: Taxonomy annotation (matrix/data.frame)
}}

\item{feature.level}{Character vector specifying one or more taxonomy levels
to aggregate by (e.g., c("Phylum", "Family", "Genus")).}
}
\value{
The input data.obj with an added/updated `feature.agg.list` component
  containing aggregated feature tables for each specified taxonomy level.
}
\description{
Aggregates a feature table within a MicrobiomeStat data object by one or more
specified taxonomy levels. The aggregated tables are stored in the
`feature.agg.list` component of the data object.
}
\details{
This function is the primary interface for taxonomy aggregation in MicrobiomeStat.
It supports aggregating to multiple taxonomy levels in a single call, storing
results in a named list for easy access.

The aggregation uses an inner join between feature.tab and feature.ann,
meaning only features present in both tables will be included in the output.
A message is displayed if any features are excluded due to mismatches.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
library(vegan)
data(peerj32.obj)

# Aggregate by multiple taxonomy levels
peerj32.obj <- mStat_aggregate_by_taxonomy(
  peerj32.obj,
  feature.level = c("Phylum", "Family", "Genus")
)

# Access aggregated tables
phylum_table <- peerj32.obj$feature.agg.list$Phylum
family_table <- peerj32.obj$feature.agg.list$Family
}

}

\code{\link{mStat_aggregate_by_taxonomy2}} for a lower-level interface
  that works directly with matrices.
