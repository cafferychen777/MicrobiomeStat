\arguments{
\item{data.obj}{A MicrobiomeStat data object, which is a list containing
at minimum the following components:
\itemize{
  \item \code{feature.tab}: A matrix of feature abundances (taxa/genes as
    rows, samples as columns)
  \item \code{meta.dat}: A data frame of sample metadata (samples as rows)
}
Optional components include:
\itemize{
  \item \code{feature.ann}: A matrix/data frame of feature annotations
    (e.g., taxonomy)
  \item \code{tree}: A phylogenetic tree object (class "phylo")
  \item \code{feature.agg.list}: Pre-aggregated feature tables by taxonomy
}
Data objects can be created using converters like
\code{\link{mStat_convert_phyloseq_to_data_obj}} or importers like
\code{\link{mStat_import_qiime2_as_data_obj}}.}

\item{subject.var}{Character string specifying the column name in meta.dat
that uniquely identifies each subject or sample unit. Required for
longitudinal and paired designs to track repeated measurements.}

\item{time.var}{Character string specifying the column name in meta.dat
containing the time variable. Required for longitudinal and paired analyses.
Should be a factor or character with meaningful time point labels.}

\item{group.var}{Character string specifying the column name in meta.dat
containing the grouping variable (e.g., treatment, condition, phenotype).
Used for between-group comparisons.}

\item{ref.level}{Character specifying the reference level for group comparisons.
If NULL, uses the first level alphabetically.}

\item{adj.vars}{Character vector specifying column names in meta.dat to be
used as covariates for adjustment in statistical models. These variables
will be included as fixed effects.}

\item{change.base}{Character or numeric specifying the baseline time point.
If NULL, uses the first unique value from time.var.}

\item{feature.change.func}{Method for calculating change: "relative change",
"log fold change", "absolute change", or a custom function.}

\item{feature.level}{Character vector specifying the taxonomic or annotation
level(s) for analysis. Should match column names in feature.ann, such as
"Phylum", "Family", "Genus", etc. Use "original" to analyze at the
original feature level without aggregation.}

\item{prev.filter}{Numeric value between 0 and 1. Features with prevalence
(proportion of non-zero samples) below this threshold will be excluded
from analysis. Default is usually 0 (no filtering).}

\item{abund.filter}{Numeric value. Features with mean abundance below this
threshold will be excluded from analysis. Default is usually 0 (no filtering).}

\item{feature.dat.type}{Character string specifying the data type of
feature.tab. One of:
\itemize{
  \item "count": Raw count data (will be normalized)
  \item "proportion": Relative abundance data (should sum to 1 per sample)
  \item "other": Pre-transformed data (no transformation applied)
}}

\item{winsor.qt}{Numeric (0-1) specifying the quantile for winsorization. Default 0.97.}
}
\value{
A nested list structure where:
\itemize{
  \item First level: Named by \code{feature.level} (e.g., "Phylum", "Genus")
  \item Second level: Named by tested comparisons between groups
        \itemize{
          \item Elements named as "Level vs Reference (Reference)"
          \item If \code{group.var} has >2 levels, includes ANOVA results
        }
  \item Each element is a data.frame with the following columns:
        \itemize{
          \item \code{Variable}: Feature/taxon name
          \item \code{Coefficient}: Effect size of the change between time points
                (interpretation depends on \code{feature.change.func}:
                for "log fold change", represents difference in log2 abundances;
                for "relative change", represents relative difference;
                for "absolute change", represents absolute difference)
          \item \code{SE}: Standard error of the coefficient from the linear model
          \item \code{P.Value}: Raw p-value from standard linear model (lm)
          \item \code{Adjusted.P.Value}: FDR-adjusted p-value using Benjamini-Hochberg method
          \item \code{Mean.Abundance}: Mean abundance of the feature across all samples
          \item \code{Prevalence}: Proportion of samples where the feature is present (non-zero)
        }
}

This function analyzes CHANGE SCORES (differences between two time points) rather than
raw abundances, using standard linear models rather than LinDA mixed-effects models.
}
\description{
Computes taxa abundance changes between two time points and tests for
differential change between groups using linear models (lm) or ANOVA.
