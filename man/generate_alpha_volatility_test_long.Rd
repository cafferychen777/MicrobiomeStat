\title{Alpha Diversity Volatility Test (Longitudinal)}
\usage{
generate_alpha_volatility_test_long(
  data.obj,
  alpha.obj = NULL,
  alpha.name = c("shannon", "observed_species"),
  depth = NULL,
  time.var,
  subject.var,
  group.var,
  adj.vars = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data.obj}{A MicrobiomeStat data object, which is a list containing
at minimum the following components:
\itemize{
  \item \code{feature.tab}: A matrix of feature abundances (taxa/genes as
    rows, samples as columns)
  \item \code{meta.dat}: A data frame of sample metadata (samples as rows)
}
Optional components include:
\itemize{
  \item \code{feature.ann}: A matrix/data frame of feature annotations
    (e.g., taxonomy)
  \item \code{tree}: A phylogenetic tree object (class "phylo")
  \item \code{feature.agg.list}: Pre-aggregated feature tables by taxonomy
}
Data objects can be created using converters like
\code{\link{mStat_convert_phyloseq_to_data_obj}} or importers like
\code{\link{mStat_import_qiime2_as_data_obj}}.}

\item{alpha.obj}{A list containing pre-calculated alpha diversity indices.
If NULL and alpha diversity is needed, it will be calculated automatically.
Names should match the alpha.name parameter (e.g., "shannon", "simpson").
See \code{\link{mStat_calculate_alpha_diversity}}.}

\item{alpha.name}{Character vector specifying which alpha diversity indices
to analyze. Options include:
\itemize{
  \item "shannon": Shannon diversity index
  \item "simpson": Simpson diversity index
  \item "observed_species": Observed species richness
  \item "chao1": Chao1 richness estimator
  \item "ace": ACE richness estimator
  \item "pielou": Pielou's evenness
}}

\item{depth}{Numeric value or NULL. Rarefaction depth for diversity
calculations. If NULL, uses minimum sample depth or no rarefaction.}

\item{time.var}{Character string specifying the column name in meta.dat
containing the time variable. Required for longitudinal and paired analyses.
Should be a factor or character with meaningful time point labels.}

\item{subject.var}{Character string specifying the column name in meta.dat
that uniquely identifies each subject or sample unit. Required for
longitudinal and paired designs to track repeated measurements.}

\item{group.var}{Character string specifying the column name in meta.dat
containing the grouping variable (e.g., treatment, condition, phenotype).
Used for between-group comparisons.}

\item{adj.vars}{Character vector specifying column names in meta.dat to be
used as covariates for adjustment in statistical models. These variables
will be included as fixed effects.}
}
\value{
A summary object containing the results of the linear model testing
  the association between alpha diversity volatility and the group variable.
}
\description{
Tests associations between alpha diversity volatility and group
  variables. Volatility is the mean absolute change between consecutive time
  points normalized by time difference.
