\arguments{
\item{data.obj}{A MicrobiomeStat data object, which is a list containing
at minimum the following components:
\itemize{
  \item \code{feature.tab}: A matrix of feature abundances (taxa/genes as
    rows, samples as columns)
  \item \code{meta.dat}: A data frame of sample metadata (samples as rows)
}
Optional components include:
\itemize{
  \item \code{feature.ann}: A matrix/data frame of feature annotations
    (e.g., taxonomy)
  \item \code{tree}: A phylogenetic tree object (class "phylo")
  \item \code{feature.agg.list}: Pre-aggregated feature tables by taxonomy
}
Data objects can be created using converters like
\code{\link{mStat_convert_phyloseq_to_data_obj}} or importers like
\code{\link{mStat_import_qiime2_as_data_obj}}.}

\item{time.var}{Character string specifying the column name in meta.dat
containing the time variable. Required for longitudinal and paired analyses.
Should be a factor or character with meaningful time point labels.}

\item{t.level}{Character string specifying the time level/value to subset data to.
Default NULL does not subset data.}

\item{group.var}{Character string specifying the column name in meta.dat
containing the grouping variable (e.g., treatment, condition, phenotype).
Used for between-group comparisons.}

\item{strata.var}{Character string specifying the column name in meta.dat
for stratification. When provided, analyses and visualizations will be
performed separately within each stratum (e.g., by site, batch, or sex).}

\item{feature.level}{Character vector specifying the taxonomic or annotation
level(s) for analysis. Should match column names in feature.ann, such as
"Phylum", "Family", "Genus", etc. Use "original" to analyze at the
original feature level without aggregation.}

\item{features.plot}{A character vector or named list specifying which feature IDs to plot.
If a named list, each element should correspond to a taxonomic level in `feature.level`.
Default is NULL, in which case features are selected based on `top.k.plot` and `top.k.func`.}

\item{feature.dat.type}{Character string specifying the data type of
feature.tab. One of:
\itemize{
  \item "count": Raw count data (will be normalized)
  \item "proportion": Relative abundance data (should sum to 1 per sample)
  \item "other": Pre-transformed data (no transformation applied)
}}

\item{top.k.plot}{Integer specifying number of top k features to plot. Default is NULL.}

\item{top.k.func}{Function to use for selecting top k features (e.g., "mean", "sd"). Default is NULL.}

\item{transform}{Transformation to apply: "identity" (default), "sqrt", or "log".}

\item{prev.filter}{Numeric value between 0 and 1. Features with prevalence
(proportion of non-zero samples) below this threshold will be excluded
from analysis. Default is usually 0 (no filtering).}

\item{abund.filter}{Numeric value. Features with mean abundance below this
threshold will be excluded from analysis. Default is usually 0 (no filtering).}

\item{base.size}{Numeric value specifying the base font size for plot text
elements. Default is typically 16.}

\item{theme.choice}{Character string specifying the ggplot2 theme to use.
Options include:
\itemize{
  \item "bw": Black and white theme (theme_bw)
  \item "classic": Classic theme (theme_classic)
  \item "minimal": Minimal theme (theme_minimal)
  \item "prism": GraphPad Prism-like theme
  \item "nature": Nature journal style
  \item "light": Light theme (theme_light)
}
Can also use a custom ggplot2 theme object via custom.theme.}

\item{custom.theme}{A custom ggplot2 theme object to override theme.choice.
Should be created using ggplot2::theme() or a complete theme function.}

\item{palette}{Character vector of colors or a named palette for the plot.
If NULL, uses default MicrobiomeStat color scheme. Can be:
\itemize{
  \item A vector of color codes (e.g., c("#E41A1C", "#377EB8"))
  \item A palette name recognized by the plotting function
}}

\item{pdf}{Logical. If TRUE, saves the plot(s) to PDF file(s) in the
current working directory. Default is TRUE.}

\item{file.ann}{Character string for additional annotation to append to
output filenames. Useful for distinguishing multiple outputs.}

\item{pdf.wid}{Numeric value specifying the width of PDF output in inches.
Default is typically 11.}

\item{pdf.hei}{Numeric value specifying the height of PDF output in inches.
Default is typically 8.5.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to be passed to the function.}
}
\value{
A list of ggplot objects for each taxonomic level.
}
\description{
Creates boxplots showing the abundance distribution of individual taxa
at specified taxonomic levels for a single time point.
}
\details{
This function generates a boxplot of taxa abundances for a single time point in a longitudinal study.
The boxplot can be stratified by a group variable and/or other variables.
It allows for different taxonomic levels to be used and a specific number of features to be included in the plot.
The function also has options to customize the size, theme, and color palette of the plot, and to save the plot as a PDF.
