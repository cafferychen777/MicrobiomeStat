\title{Beta Diversity Volatility Test for Longitudinal Data}
\usage{
generate_beta_volatility_test_long(
  data.obj,
  dist.obj = NULL,
  subject.var,
  time.var,
  group.var = NULL,
  adj.vars = NULL,
  dist.name = c("BC"),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data.obj}{A MicrobiomeStat data object, which is a list containing
at minimum the following components:
\itemize{
  \item \code{feature.tab}: A matrix of feature abundances (taxa/genes as
    rows, samples as columns)
  \item \code{meta.dat}: A data frame of sample metadata (samples as rows)
}
Optional components include:
\itemize{
  \item \code{feature.ann}: A matrix/data frame of feature annotations
    (e.g., taxonomy)
  \item \code{tree}: A phylogenetic tree object (class "phylo")
  \item \code{feature.agg.list}: Pre-aggregated feature tables by taxonomy
}
Data objects can be created using converters like
\code{\link{mStat_convert_phyloseq_to_data_obj}} or importers like
\code{\link{mStat_import_qiime2_as_data_obj}}.}

\item{dist.obj}{A list of pre-calculated distance matrices. If NULL and
distances are needed, they will be calculated automatically.
List names should match dist.name (e.g., "BC" for Bray-Curtis).
See \code{\link{mStat_calculate_beta_diversity}}.}

\item{subject.var}{Character string specifying the column name in meta.dat
that uniquely identifies each subject or sample unit. Required for
longitudinal and paired designs to track repeated measurements.}

\item{time.var}{Character string specifying the column name in meta.dat
containing the time variable. Required for longitudinal and paired analyses.
Should be a factor or character with meaningful time point labels.}

\item{group.var}{Character string specifying the column name in meta.dat
containing the grouping variable (e.g., treatment, condition, phenotype).
Used for between-group comparisons.}

\item{adj.vars}{Character vector specifying column names in meta.dat to be
used as covariates for adjustment in statistical models. These variables
will be included as fixed effects.}

\item{dist.name}{Character vector specifying which distance metrics to use.
Options depend on available methods:
\itemize{
  \item "BC": Bray-Curtis dissimilarity
  \item "Jaccard": Jaccard distance
  \item "UniFrac": Unweighted UniFrac (requires tree)
  \item "GUniFrac": Generalized UniFrac (requires tree)
  \item "WUniFrac": Weighted UniFrac (requires tree)
  \item "JS": Jensen-Shannon divergence
}}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to internal functions.}
}
\value{
A list containing the result of the volatility test for each specified beta diversity index.
  Each element in the list is a tibble with the coefficients extracted from the linear model fitted
  for each distance, and an ANOVA table if the group variable is multi-categorical.
}
\description{
Tests association between beta diversity volatility and group variable
for longitudinal microbiome data.
}
\details{
The function starts by validating the input data, processing the time variable, and calculating the beta diversity if necessary.
Adjustments are made based on the provided adjusting variables. The volatility of the beta diversity is
computed for each subject, and linear models are fitted to test the association between volatility and
the specified group variable. The coefficients and ANOVA results are extracted and returned for each
beta diversity index specified.
}
\note{
A warning message will be displayed to ensure that the time variable is coded as numeric.
Non-numeric coding may lead to issues in the volatility test computation.
