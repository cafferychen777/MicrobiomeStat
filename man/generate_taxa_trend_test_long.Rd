\arguments{
\item{data.obj}{A list object in a format specific to MicrobiomeStat, which can include components such as feature.tab (matrix), feature.ann (matrix), meta.dat (data.frame), tree, and feature.agg.list (list). The data.obj can be converted from other formats using several functions from the MicrobiomeStat package, including: 'mStat_convert_DGEList_to_data_obj', 'mStat_convert_DESeqDataSet_to_data_obj', 'mStat_convert_phyloseq_to_data_obj', 'mStat_convert_SummarizedExperiment_to_data_obj', 'mStat_import_qiime2_as_data_obj', 'mStat_import_mothur_as_data_obj', 'mStat_import_dada2_as_data_obj', and 'mStat_import_biom_as_data_obj'. Alternatively, users can construct their own data.obj. Note that not all components of data.obj may be required for all functions in the MicrobiomeStat package.}

\item{subject.var}{A character string that indicates the column name in the metadata which uniquely identifies each subject or sample.}

\item{time.var}{A character string representing the time variable column in the metadata. Time points should be numeric. If not, the function will convert it to numeric. Default is NULL.}

\item{group.var}{A character string specifying the grouping variable column in the metadata.
Can be either:
\itemize{
  \item Categorical (factor or character): Tests group differences and group × time interaction
  \item Continuous (numeric or integer): Tests linear association with time
}
This variable differentiates between different experimental or observational groups.}

\item{adj.vars}{A vector of character strings. Each string should denote a column name in the metadata that will serve as a covariate in the analysis. These variables might account for potential confounding influences. Default is NULL.}

\item{feature.level}{A character string indicating the taxonomic resolution for analysis (e.g., "Phylum", "Class"). This choice will determine the granularity of the analysis.}

\item{prev.filter}{Numeric value specifying the minimum prevalence threshold for filtering
taxa before analysis. Taxa with prevalence below this value will be removed.
Prevalence is calculated as the proportion of samples where the taxon is present.}

\item{abund.filter}{Numeric value specifying the minimum abundance threshold for filtering
taxa before analysis. Taxa with mean abundance below this value will be removed.
Abundance refers to counts or proportions depending on \code{feature.dat.type}.}

\item{feature.dat.type}{The type of the feature data, which determines how the data is handled.
Should be one of:
\itemize{
  \item "count": Raw count data. This function will first apply TSS (Total Sum Scaling) normalization,
        then LinDA performs zero-handling using half-minimum approach for statistical testing
  \item "proportion": Pre-normalized proportional data (e.g., relative abundances).
        LinDA performs zero-handling using half-minimum approach without additional normalization
  \item "other": Pre-transformed data (e.g., CLR, log-transformed).
        Uses standard linear mixed models without normalization or zero-handling
}
Default is "count".}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to cater to any specialized requirements. For now, these are placeholder and not used.}
}
\value{
A nested list structure where:
\itemize{
  \item First level: Named by \code{feature.level} (e.g., "Phylum", "Genus")
  \item Second level: Named by tested effects (e.g., "time", "group:time interaction")
        \itemize{
          \item For categorical \code{group.var}: Separate elements for each non-reference level
                (e.g., "Treatment vs Control (Reference)")
          \item For continuous \code{group.var}: Single element named by the variable
          \item Time effects and interactions are also included depending on the model
        }
  \item Each element is a data.frame with the following columns:
        \itemize{
          \item \code{Variable}: Feature/taxon name
          \item \code{Coefficient}: Effect size. For time effects, represents change per unit time.
                For group effects, represents log2 fold change. For interactions, represents
                difference in trends between groups
          \item \code{SE}: Standard error of the coefficient
          \item \code{P.Value}: Raw p-value from the statistical test (mixed-effects model or LinDA)
          \item \code{Adjusted.P.Value}: FDR-adjusted p-value using Benjamini-Hochberg method
          \item \code{Mean.Abundance}: Mean abundance of the feature across all samples
          \item \code{Prevalence}: Proportion of samples where the feature is present (non-zero)
        }
}
}
\description{
This function is designed to conduct a longitudinal trend test on microbiome data. The primary aim is to discern how the abundance of various microbial taxa changes over time and/or in response to different experimental or observational groups. The function delivers robust statistical insights that enable researchers to draw meaningful conclusions about the dynamics of microbial populations.

\details{
Based on whether group.var, adj.vars, and time.var are NULL, the formula tests:

- When time.var is NULL:
  - When group.var is NULL and adj.vars is NOT NULL:
    - Tests adj.vars main effects only.
    - Adjusted for adj.vars but not for group.var or time.var.
  - When group.var is NOT NULL and adj.vars is NOT NULL:
    - Tests adj.vars and group.var main effects.
    - Adjusted for adj.vars but not for time.var.
  - When group.var is NOT NULL and adj.vars is NULL:
    - Tests group.var main effects only.
    - Unadjusted for adj.vars but adjusted for group.var.
  - When both group.var and adj.vars are NULL:
    - Tests the intercept only.
    - Unadjusted analysis.

- When time.var is NOT NULL:
  - When group.var is NULL and adj.vars is NOT NULL:
    - Tests adj.vars and time.var main effects.
    - Adjusted for adj.vars but not for group.var.
  - When group.var is NOT NULL and adj.vars is NOT NULL:
    - Tests adj.vars main effects.
    - Tests group.var and time.var main effects.
    - Tests group.var x time.var interaction.
    - Adjusted for adj.vars.
  - When group.var is NOT NULL and adj.vars is NULL:
    - Tests group.var and time.var main effects.
    - Tests group.var x time.var interaction.
    - Unadjusted analysis.
  - When both group.var and adj.vars are NULL:
    - Tests time.var main effect only.
    - Unadjusted analysis.

The formula combines the appropriate terms based on which variables are NULL.
Subject variability is accounted for through random effects.

When group.var = NULL and adj.vars = NULL and time.var is NOT NULL,
the slope of time.var is tested without adjusting for any additional covariates.
