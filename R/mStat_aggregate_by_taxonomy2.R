#' Aggregate OTU Table by Taxonomy Level
#'
#' This function aggregates an OTU table by a specified taxonomy level.
#' It checks for consistency between OTU and taxonomy tables before aggregation.
#'
#' @param feature.tab OTU table as matrix or data.frame
#' @param feature.ann Taxonomy table as matrix or data.frame
#' @param feature.level Taxonomy level to aggregate by as character vector.
#'
#' @return Aggregated OTU table matrix.
#'
#'
#' @details
#' The function first checks that the row names of OTU and taxonomy tables match.
#' If any mismatches are found, a message is displayed but the function continues.
#' The OTU and taxonomy tables are joined by row names.
#' The OTU table is then aggregated by summing abundance values for each sample at the specified taxonomy level.
#' Rows with all zero values after aggregation are removed.
